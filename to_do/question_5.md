Using the explore **Gsod**:

1. Create a Look that contains a table visualization with the total rainfall per station.
2. Within the Look, calculate the standard deviation of these results. Do not display this in the visualization.
3. Create an additional column, applying the 3-sigma rule, to determine whether a row is an outlier or not.
4. Only display the rows in the table visualization that are NOT outliers.
